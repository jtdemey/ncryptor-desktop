# Ncryptor Desktop

Use public-key cryptography to send private messages over *any* application.

Ncryptor Desktop is a simple, cross-platform program used to invoke the [GNU Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/). It uses [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) to encrypt plain text messages that can be safely sent over any messaging platform.

## How it works

Let's say *Sly* wants to send *Bentley* an address to meet at.

1. They both download and run *Ncryptor* on their own machines, as well as their favorite unsecure messaging platform â€” say, [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).
2. They each generate a short-lived RSA keypair from the Keyring view.
3. Each RSA keypair has a **private key** (or **secret key**) and a **public key**. Sly and Bentley send each other their public keys over Discord.
4. They import each other's public keys from the Contacts view.
5. Sly types the address into the Encrypt view and clicks "Encrypt" to encrypt the text with Bentley's public key
6. Sly sends the encrypted text to Bentley over Discord, who then pastes the text into his *Ncryptor*.
7. Bentley clicks "Decrypt" to view the secret message securely.

They can each repeat steps 5-7 each time they want to send a private message over the Internet.

## Security

Ncryptor Desktop is an open-source React frontend that uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) to run as a native application outside of the browser. Aside from anything that may be included in Tauri itself, this program doesn't have any telemetry nor does it make any HTTP requests. Tauri uses [Microsoft Edge WebViews](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).
